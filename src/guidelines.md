brown rice per oz: -32 cals -0.2g fat -6.7g carbs -0.7g protein

broccoli per oz: -10 cals -0.1g fat -2g carbs -2.17g protein

grilled chicken per oz: -40 cals -0.9g fat -0g carbs -7.5g protein

grams dived by 28.35 equals ounces

always carb/fat/protein, examples below will be with brown rice, chicken, and broccoli

1. establish macro goals. 250/50/15
2. establish calorie limit. i.e. 2500
3. take carb numbers from given foods, in this case rice and broccoli. So if we need 250g of carbs, how many ounces of rice and broccoli gets us there? We know that every ounce of rice, there are
   6.7g carbs, and that for every ounce of broccoli, there 2g carbs. (We wouldn't want to just divide the required carbs between the 2 of these evenly, as that would be an obscene amount of broccoli, so we might need to add another key/value that establishes a priority level or heirarchy).
4. Compare the ratio of carb grams between the two and. Whatever that ratio is, in this case it's 3.35, use it to split the amount of each food. So if we need 250g of carbs, and there are 3.35 times as many grams of carbs in an ounce of rice versus an ounce of broccoli, then we divide 250 by 3.35 (~75). So it'll be 175g from rice and 75g from broccoli.
5. Take 175g of carbs and divide it by 6.7g per ounce from rice (our desired amount is ~26 oz of rice) and 75g of carbs divided by 2(our desired amount is ~37 oz of broccoli)
6. Those numbers will have overlapped into fat and protein though, so we have to account for that. 26oz of rice will yield 18g protein, and 37oz of broccoli will yield 17g protein, for a total of 35g of protein before we get to our classic protein.
7. 115g of protein remain, which will require 15oz of chicken
8. 15oz of chicken will yield 13.5g fat
9. 5g of fat from the rice and 4g of fat from the broccoli make our fat total 23g.
